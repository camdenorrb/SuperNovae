Remove the low level and just focus on high level

Make a graphql like thingy for select responses to reduce message size

Figure out why packed doesn't work

Add scalability and make it like cockroachdb redundancy wise

Add SQL compiler

Maybe add optional responses

Simplify the high level setup

Add a synced cache implementation, where you can tell it what to do if a change is received

Make it so you can't use path separators in the table name and empty table/database/file names, to prevent exploits

Maybe a delete table on stop option, which caches everything and uses no files?

Move to BSON: https://github.com/jershell/kbson

Auto reloading files when changed

Keep alive
